        <h3>What SAMonitor does</h3>
        <p>SAMonitor offers a free and open source server monitoring service to the community.</p>
        <p>This is done partly in the shape of this website, available to end users, and in the shape of our <a href="https://github.com/markski1/SAMonitor">open API</a> to developers and server/site operators.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>For server owners, this means a way for players to find their server.</li>
            <li>For players, this means a way to browse through servers in a comfortable way.</li>
            <li>For developers, this means free access to all the information SAMonitor collects.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>SAMonitor currently gets ~1,200 unique visitors per day. The masterlist mod gets ~400-600 unique users per day.</p>

    <div class="innerContent">
        <h3>Website partnership</h3>
        <p>A website partnership is that in which, if you mention SAMonitor in your service's website, yours will be shown in SAMonitor.</p>
        <img style="width: 100%; max-width: 640px" alt="Example website partnership screenshot" src="../assets/img/partner_example.png"><br>
        <small>Example image.</small>
        <p>This spot is shared across every partner. When a user visits, there'll be a chance that your message is shown to them.</p>
        <p>The maximum amount of partners is 5, to make sure everyone gets a couple hundred views per day.</p>
    </div>
    <!--<div class="innerContent">
        <h3>Server sponsorship</h3>
        <p>You may sponsor a server in SAMonitor for a price of 8 USD per 30 days.<br>Sponsored servers will be marked in green on the website, and be at the top of the masterlist.</p>
        <img style="width: 100%; max-width: 640px" alt="Example website partnership screenshot" src="../assets/img/donator_example.png"><br>
        <small>Example image.</small>
        <p><b>There is a maximum limit of 4 sponsored servers.</b> I want to give users a good experience by not making it just a long list of sponsored servers.</p>
        <p>This limit makes it clear that I am not "getting rich" from SAMonitor. It is a passion project in which I just want a little funding on.</p>
