    <p>Information regarding donating to SAMonitor.</p>
    <div class="innerContent">
        <h3>What SAMonitor does</h3>
        <p>SAMonitor offers free and open server monitoring to the community.</p>

        <p>For server owners, this means a way for players to find their server.</p>

        <p>For players, this means a way to browse through servers in a comfortable way.</p>

        <p>For developers, this means free access to all the information SAMonitor collects.</p>
    </div>

    <p>It is very important to make it clear that nothing is being sold here.<br />Donations are not a promotional tool, they're just to help the service.</p>
    <p>So, before donating, consider the following:</p>
    
    <div class="innerContent">
        <h3>What donations do</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Help cover the costs of hosting and developing the service.</li>
            <li>The name and/or organization of a donor will be added to a "Sponsors" section of this page, and remain there forever.</li>
            <li>Optionally, a server of the donor's choosing will show up in green instead of purple in the servers page for 30 days.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What donations <span style="text-decoration: underline">won't</span> do</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Promote your server</b>: </li>
            While you're getting a green box for 30 days, this will not improve it's positioning in the list in any way. If your server doesn't show up in the first page now, it won't do after donating either.
            <li><b>Protect your server</b>: </li>
            If your server or staff is found to engage in harmful activity, such as the ones listed in the 'blacklist' page, you will be blacklisted all the same.
        </ul>
    </div>
